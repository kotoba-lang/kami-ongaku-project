(ns kami.ongaku.project
  "Portable DAW-session data model: tracks, buses (a real bus graph, not a
  flat list), tick-placed clips, parameter automation, and a tick-keyed
  tempo map. The L3 SSoT of the `ongaku` domain per ADR-2607121400 — this
  is the layer that actually ties `kami.ongaku.notation` (score IR) and
  `kami.ongaku.sequencer` (MIDI-equivalent event IR) into one session, the
  way a Logic Pro/Cubase/Ableton project file does.

  v0 scope: pure session/graph data model + referential-integrity
  validation. No audio rendering, no plugin execution (plugin instances
  are opaque refs here; the plugin *contract* itself is
  `kami-ongaku-plugin-host`'s job, Wave 3 of ADR-2607121400).

  Portable .cljc across JVM / ClojureScript. Ticks are plain integers at
  :project/ppq resolution, matching kami.ongaku.sequencer's convention —
  no float/ratio time arithmetic here."
